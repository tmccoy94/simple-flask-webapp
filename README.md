Code along project - tech with tim

I uploaded this for others who are coding along with this project. I had to make a few minor changes in order to get finish the website but I did do it.

You should see all the changes I had to make highlighted with "# ------". I'm pretty sure I highlighted all of them although I may be wrong.

Happy coding!
